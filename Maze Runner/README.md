# Project: Maze Runner

This project is by Jetbrains Academy.

## About

Mazes are amazing: keep running, find the exit if you can! If you are not too happy about getting stuck in the actual
maze, you can entertain yourself with a virtual one. In this project, you will write a program that generates mazes and
looks for a way out.

## Learning outcomes

Learn to use Random class with lists and multidimensional arrays and store the results in a file.
