# Project: Phone Book

This project is by Jetbrains Academy.

## About

You suddenly remember you need to call your aunt and wish her a happy birthday, but how do you find her number quickly
in a giant phonebook? Write a program that will solve this problem once and forever: create a phonebook where you can
easily, quickly and efficiently find necessary information. Names and numbers, here we come.

## Learning outcomes

You will learn a variety of sorting and search algorithms, one of which is recursive. If it is algorithm competence that
youâ€™re after, this project is definitely for you.
