# Project: JSON - XML converter
https://hyperskill.org/projects/61

This project is by Jetbrains Academy.

## About

JSON and XML are data formats that allow us to store data in a way that is readable by both a computer and a human. JSON
and XML are common formats of storing data, and since both are used, it is sometimes necessary to convert one format
into the other. In this project, you will write a converter like that, getting useful experience in working with
websites in the meantime. Due to the level of difficulty, this project will suit advanced learners who are confident
enough and want to challenge their programming skills. Check the prerequisites, take a deep breath, and letâ€™s work!

## Learning outcomes

Get to know both formats (JSON and XML), gain more experience with collections and figure out object-oriented
programming once and for all.
