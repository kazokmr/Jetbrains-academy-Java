## About

Looks like you like challenges! This project, however, is not too tricky if you’re feeling like an advanced learner. A

you’re ready, let’s roll!

## Learning outcomes

Apart from applying your basic knowledge about loops, strings, methods, classes and other topics, you will get a grasp
of SWING, a widget library for GUI (graphical user interface).
